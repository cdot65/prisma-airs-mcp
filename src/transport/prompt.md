Maintain enterprise standards while leveraging all project context from `.claude/` directories and ensuring alignment with TypeScript conventions and linting standards.

## Five bad examples:

❌ 1. Vague and Generic Request
Create a GitHub Pages site for my project. Make it look nice and include all the important stuff. Check the code and make documentation.

Why this is bad:

Doesn't reference the .claude/ directory structure
No specific guidance on what to analyze
Ignores existing documentation and context files
Too vague about requirements and scope

❌ 2. Overly Complex and Confusing
You need to create a GitHub Pages site but first analyze every single file in the entire repository including node_modules and dist and then create 47 different types of documentation pages and also build a custom CMS system and integrate it with 12 different APIs and make sure to include blockchain functionality and AI chatbots and also create mobile apps and desktop applications while ensuring the site works on Internet Explorer 6 and also include a dating app feature and cryptocurrency wallet integration.

Why this is bad:

Overly complex and unrealistic scope
Includes irrelevant requirements (blockchain, dating app)
Doesn't prioritize the important project context
Ignores the actual project structure and needs

❌ 3. Ignores Existing Project Structure
Build a generic documentation site. Don't worry about the existing files, just create something from scratch. Make up some API documentation and add some random code examples.
Why this is bad:

Explicitly ignores existing project context
Doesn't leverage the .claude/ directory structure
Asks to "make up" documentation instead of using real project info
Disregards actual source code in src/

❌ 4. Only Focuses on One Aspect
Just look at the src/ directory and create API docs. Nothing else needed.

Why this is bad:

Too narrow in scope
Ignores valuable context in .claude/ directories
Doesn't consider other important project files
Misses opportunity for comprehensive documentation

❌ 5. Inconsistent and Contradictory Instructions
Create documentation but don't look at the documentation folder. Use the source code but ignore the conventions. Make it professional but keep it casual. Include everything but keep it minimal. Follow the TypeScript guide but use JavaScript examples. Reference the API schema but don't include API documentation.

Why this is bad:

Contains contradictory instructions
Confusing and impossible to execute effectively
Doesn't provide clear guidance on using project context
Would result in inconsistent and poor-quality output

Key Differences Between Good and Bad Examples:
Good Examples:

✅ Specifically reference .claude/ directory structure and contents
✅ Provide systematic approach to analyzing project context
✅ Consider multiple information sources (src/, docs/, root files)
✅ Give clear, actionable instructions
✅ Maintain consistency with project conventions
✅ Focus on user needs and project goals
Bad Examples:

❌ Ignore existing project structure and context
❌ Are too vague or overly complex
❌ Don't leverage available documentation and conventions
❌ Contain contradictory or confusing instructions
❌ Focus on irrelevant features or miss important aspects
❌ Don't consider the actual project needs and structure
