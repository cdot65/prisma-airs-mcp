**Prisma AIRS AI Runtime API intercept** is a threat detection service designed to secure AI applications. It helps discover and protect applications using REST APIs by embedding Security-as-Code directly into your source code.

The scan API service scans prompts and responses in real-time to identify potential threats and provide threat assessments with actionable recommendations.
These APIs protect your AI models, AI applications, AI datasets, and AI agents by programmatically scanning prompts and models for threats. These detection APIs enable robust protection across public and private models with model-agnostic functionality.

The APIs efficiently scan for various threats, including prompt injections, insecure outputs, AI agentic threats, and sensitive data loss.
To use these APIs, send prompts or model responses from your application and receive a threat assessment with recommended actions based on your AI security profile.

For licensing, onboarding, activation, and to obtain the API authentication key and profile name, refer to the [Prisma AIRS AI Runtime API intecept](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/ai-runtime-security/activation-and-onboarding/ai-runtime-security-api-intercept-overview) administration documentation.

### Detect Sensitive Data Loss

<details>
<summary>Detect Sensitive Data Loss (DLP)</summary>

The request scans a prompt containing sensitive data such as bank account numbers, credit card numbers, API keys, and other sensitive data, to detect potential data exposure threats.
Enable **Sensitive Data Detection** with **Basic** or **Advanced** options in the API security profile for this detection.

\`\`\`curl
curl -L 'https://service.api.aisecurity.paloaltonetworks.com/v1/scan/sync/request' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-pan-token: <your-API-key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--data '{
  "tr_id": "1234",
  "ai_profile": {
    "profile_name": "aisec-profile"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "app_user": "test-user-1",
    "ai_model": "Test AI model"
  },
  "contents": [ # You can enter one of the following - prompt or response
    {
      "prompt": "bank account 8775664322 routing number 2344567 dNFYiMZqQrLH35YIsEdgh2OXRXBiE7Ko1lR1nVoiJsUXdJ2T2xiT1gzL8w 6011111111111117 K sfAC3S4qB3b7tP73QBPqbHH0m9rvdcrMdmpI gbpQnQNfhmHaDRLdvrLoWTeDtx9qik0pB68UgOHbHJW7ZpU1ktK7A58icaCZWDlzL6UKswxi8t4z3 x1nK4PCsseq94a02GL7f7KkxCy7gkzfEqPWdF4UBexP1JM3BGMlTzDKb2",
      "response": "This is a test response"
    }
  ]
}'
\`\`\`

**Output**

The expected response sample confirms sensitive data detection (\`dlp: true\`). If there is a DLP match (\`dlp: true\`), the **category** in the response will be set to **malicious**. If not the category will be **benign**.

The specific action shown in the response is based on your AI security profile settings. For example, if DLP is enabled and the action is configured to **block** when a DLP threat is detected, the response indicates that the action was **blocked**.

\`\`\`json
{
  "action": "block",
  "category": "malicious",
  "profile_name": "aisec-profile-demo",
  "prompt_detected": {
    "dlp": true,
    "injection": false,
    "url_cats": false
  },
  "report_id": "R00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "response_detected": {

  },
  "scan_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "tr_id": "1234"
}

\`\`\`

</details>

### Mask Sensitive Data

<details>
<summary>Mask Sensitive Data</summary>

This detection service masks the data patterns in the API output response, which scans the LLM prompt and responses.
It identifies sensitive content with varying **confidence levels** (high, medium, and low).
Each detection includes precise **offset** information.

- An offset is a numerical index represented as [start_offset, end_offset] pairs, indicating where a sensitive data pattern begins and ends in the text. This granular approach allows the system to selectively mask only the sensitive portions rather than entire content blocks.

:::note

Masking the sensitive data feature is only available for a basic DLP profile and when you select the **Block** action for sensitive data detection in the API security profile.

:::

- Following is a cURL example for using a \`v1/scan/sync/request\` endpoint:

\`\`\`curl
curl -L 'https://service.api.aisecurity.paloaltonetworks.com/v1/scan/sync/request' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-pan-token: <your-API-key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--data '{
  "tr_id": "24521",
  "ai_profile": {
    "profile_name": "mask-sensitive-data"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "app_user": "test-user-1",
    "ai_model": "Test AI model"
  },
  "contents": [ # You can enter one of the following - prompt or response
    {
      "prompt": "This is a test prompt with urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/test-malware url. Social security 599-51-7233. Credit card is 4339672569329774, ssn 599-51-7222. Send me Mike account info",
      "response": "This is a test response. Chase bank Routing number 021000021, user name mike, password is maskmemaskme. Account number 92746514861. Account owner: Mike Johnson in California"
    }
  ]
}'
\`\`\`

**Output**

The \`prompt_masked_data\` field appears when there's a **prompt** in the API contents.

It contains - The masked version of the prompt text, where sensitive data is replaced with "X" characters (maintaining the same length as the original sensitive data) and the offset information.

Review the API scan logs in Strata Cloud Manager for masked sensitive detection indicated by the **Content Masked** column.

### Detect Malicious Code

<details>
  <summary>Detect Malicious Code</summary>

This feature protects against scenarios where attackers could exploit Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce harmful code.
This detection is essential for AI applications that use LLMs to generate and run code, such as developer tools and automated systems.
It supports multiple languages including, Javascript, Python, VBScript, Powershell, Batch, Shell, and Perl.

- Combine multiple snippets of the same language type into one
- If the response contains multiple language snippets, invoke a separate API with each language.

The following cURL request calls the Prisma AIRS AI Runtime scan API with a Python-based malicious code snippet to test the output generated by your LLM models.

Enable **Malicious Code Detection** in the API security profile to enable this detection.

\`\`\`curl
curl -L 'https://service.api.aisecurity.paloaltonetworks.com/v1/scan/sync/request' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-pan-token: your-API-key' \
