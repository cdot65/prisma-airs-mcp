# Session Summary - July 16, 2025

## Session Overview

This session focused on security hardening the Prisma AIRS MCP server repository in preparation for making it public.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Security Audit and Remediation

**Found and Fixed:**
- Removed hardcoded API key from `k8s/overlays/production/kustomization.yaml`
- Cleaned exposed API key from `docs/DEPLOYMENT-CONFIG-REFERENCE.md`
- Verified `.env` file with OAuth credentials is already in `.gitignore`

**Security Improvements:**
- Created `kustomization.yaml.example` with placeholder values
- Added production kustomization.yaml to `.gitignore`
- Created comprehensive `SECURITY.md` with security policies

### 2. Documentation Updates

**New Files Created:**
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy and best practices
- `k8s/overlays/production/kustomization.yaml.example` - Safe example file
- `docs/KUBERNETES-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT-CONFIG-REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference for configurations

**Updated Files:**
- `README.md` - Added production setup instructions
- `k8s/README.md` - Added example file setup steps
- `.gitignore` - Added production config to prevent accidents
- All project tracking files updated to v1.3.5

### 3. Version 1.3.5 Release

**Key Changes:**
- Security hardening for public repository release
- Removed all hardcoded secrets from codebase
- Created example files for sensitive configurations
- Enhanced documentation with security setup instructions
- Repository prepared for safe public release

## Current Status

- **Production Deployment**: Live at https://airs.cdot.io/prisma-airs
- **Version**: 1.3.5
- **Security Status**: Hardened and ready for public release
- **All Phases Complete**: Including new Phase 11 (Security Hardening)

## Next Steps Before Public Release

1. **CRITICAL**: Rotate the exposed API key if still active
2. Review git history for any previously committed secrets
3. Run security scanning tools (git-secrets, trufflehog)
4. Update GitHub repository settings for public access
5. Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD with proper secrets
6. Add pre-commit hooks for ongoing security

## Files to Load in Next Session

For continuity, load these files in the next Claude Code session:

```
Read .claude/context/TASKS.md, .claude/context/SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-07-16.md, CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, and SECURITY.md to understand the current project status and continue from where we left off.
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. Used example files approach instead of environment variable substitution in Kustomize
2. Added production config to .gitignore for extra safety
3. Created comprehensive security documentation
4. Prepared for transition from private to public repository

## Technical Context

- All sensitive data removed from codebase
- Security best practices documented
- Deployment guides updated with security instructions
- Repository structure ready for public consumption

The project is now security-hardened and ready for public release after completing the remaining pre-release tasks.
